# Getting Started
This application is meant as a basic clone for spotify to practice spotify API usage.

# What you need to get this app running:
A spotify developer account with a created application and client ID, etc.
A simple backend to handle the login request coming from the frontend using Spotify's Authentication Flow. The default IP used in this project is https://localhost:8888 for the backend. Spotify's Authorization Code Flow can be found here https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/tutorials/code-flow

Note: This application does not implement refresh tokens as part of its authorization flow, if things dont seem to be running correctly, log out and re-log in, as the token has probably expired.
